## Week 1 *(May 19-23)*:
### Day 1:
During the first day, much of the time was spent addressing initial set-up of the two Jetson Nano devices and explaining the project. We realized only one board was installed with Ubuntu 20.04 with CUDA enabled, with the other not having CUDA and running unsupported Ubuntu 18.04. This second board will need to be upgraded to 20.04 for supported functionality and consistent environment testing, but for simplicity, we will not need to enable CUDA on it. The computer vision algorithms will be used on the Nano that has CUDA, while testing for Speech-to-Text/Automatic Speech Recognition will take place on the other board. We ran into many problems trying power on the devices, but resolved these issues once a found compatible cables and power outlets as well as switching the boards to the correct power mode. With functioning Nano devices, we will be looking to start installing the software we require for the project to begin initial testing and benchmarking. 
### Day 2: 
This day was starting to focus more on installing the computer vision libraries necessary. Many of the libraries needed were already installed, along with Python 3.8, on the system, however these are not the most up-to-date versions of the software. Ubuntu 20.04 comes out the box only up to Python 3.8 though, so for simplicity, we will start by just using the libraries on this version and upgrade only if necessary later, since all the needed libraries should work with this Python version. Ultralytics is the only library of interest in which the latest version is available on Python 3.8, which is essential since it provides support for YOLOv11 to run the optimized models. The main libraries of interest are PyTorch, TensorRT, Ultralytics (YOLO), ONNX, and potentially others, which will all be compared side by side for benchmarking once they are installed and functioning soon. The Nano devices also were having trouble connecting to the internet, however, so progress was halted until they are registered to the network or some other workaround. The libraries will be installed using a newly created virtual environment on Python 3.8, ensuring reproducible installations and library environment. Testing camera usage will hopefully follow.
