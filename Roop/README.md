## Week 1:
### Day 1:
Focused on getting a deeper general understanding for the project and its intended direction as well as a better feel for the features that we want implemented for this summers research. Additionally division of work to make sure that there as an equal distribution for each of our ecxpereince levels and comfortability with the different tasks at hand. Aaron has a better understanding of hardware than me and I plan on learning from him these first couple of days to better understand how to work with hardware. The main focus for today was to get the Jetson Nano devices to run and connect to a monitor for display. To do this we had to troubleshoot power issues as well as make sure that the pin outs of the SDK are working as intended with the diffferent attachments such as the fan for cooling the GPU. Additionally once able to diplay the information from the devices onto a monitor we were then able to check the software capabilities of the SDK's as we have to ensure the drivers and softwares installed are up to date and compatible with the models that we intend on implementing. For instance the Jetson Nano device from seed studio was running on ubuntu 18 which is outdated for most software packages.
