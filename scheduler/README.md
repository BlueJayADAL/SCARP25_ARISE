The AMRO algorithm is a novel dynamic scheduling algorithm designed to efficiently manage concurrent AI workloads on resource-constrained heterogeneous edge platforms, like the Raspberry Pi 5 CPU and Hailo-8 NPU. Its primary goals are to maximize resource utilization and minimize end-to-end latency for multimodal interactions, which are crucial for a responsive user experience in systems like ARISE. This code base is a simulation of running AMRO algorithms against other well-known scheduling algorithms under different task senarios.
